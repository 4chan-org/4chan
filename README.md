This is the original source code powering 4chan, an anonymous imageboard launched in 2003. The codebase was designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy on minimal hosting resources. It draws heavy inspiration from Japanese imageboards such as Futaba Channel (2chan), and was initially written in PHP with a MySQL backend.
